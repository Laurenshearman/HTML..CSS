    <h1>Have you ever had a pizza from sracth? 
    </h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?
    </h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the suace on first, before you make the base, it doesnt work?
    </h3>
    <h4>Or if you put the cheese on the sauce its messed up too</h4>

    <p>Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are 
    certain things we have to do first. Like making the 
    base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the 
    sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve.
    Not all pizzas end up the same,
    but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. 
    You can have everything you need to make many 
    different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p>

    </h5>This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    
    <p><small>There are some specific steps you need to take to make a pizza, we will list them here.</small></p>

        <li>Bake</li> 
        <li>Cut</li>
